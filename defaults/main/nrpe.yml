# NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor)
# Allows you to remotely execute Nagios plugins on other Linux/Unix
# machines. This allows you to monitor remote machine metrics (disk
# usage, CPU load, etc.). NRPE can also communicate with some of the
# Windows agent addons, so you can execute scripts and check metrics
# on remote Windows machines as well.
